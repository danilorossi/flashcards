This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app): check the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/README.md).

# Installing

* `npm run ios`: like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

* `npm run android`: like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator.

Check the original [Create Native App guide](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/README.md) for more details.
